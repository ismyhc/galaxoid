GALAXOID
========

This is a game built using Chingu/Gosu ruby game library. It is mainly a learning experience for myself, but ultimate goal would be to build the game to be a fully functional and fun retro style game!

I plan on bundling this game into installable package for mac and windows. As for now you will need to have the following installed.

__Ruby 1.9.2 +__
__Chingu__

These should give you all the dependencies needed for Galaxoid.
