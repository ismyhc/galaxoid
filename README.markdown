GALAXOID
========

This is a game built using Chingu/Gosu ruby game library. It is mainly a learning experience for myself, but ultimate goal would be to build the game to be a fully functional and fun retro style game!

I will have links to windows and osx builds up soon!

If you want to run from source:

git clone
bundle install
ruby lib/main.rb
